/Carbon/ helps you write better C/C++ tests. ðŸ™‚

/Carbon/ is a testing framework that focuses on being lightweight and straightforward, giving the best possible development experience. Whether you work on GNU/Linux, BSDs, Windows or macOS, if you write C/C++ code, /Carbon/ can help you.

* Usage

** Get the code

We can get /Carbon/ in our preferred way of managing dependencies or external libraries in our projects. Here are the main options of obtaining the library:

*Git Submodules:*
#+begin_src sh
git submodule add https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon vendor/carbon
cd vendor/carbon && git switch -d v0.8-alpha
#+end_src

*CMake FetchContent:*
#+begin_src cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  carbon
  GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon"
  GIT_TAG        v0.8-alpha
  GIT_PROGRESS   TRUE
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(carbon)
#+end_src

*Pre-compiled Package:*
#+begin_src sh
wget https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon/releases/download/v0.8-alpha/carbon-0.8-linux-amd64.tgz
tar -xvf carbon-0.8-linux-amd64.tgz
#+end_src

If wanted to build /Carbon/ from source independently (i.e. without defining ~CARBON_IMPLEMENTATION~ in your code), it can be done without any problems. We use a custom ~make~ utility (which uses /Carbon/ under the hood) as our build system to manage testing, compiling and packaging the library.

#+begin_src sh
cc -std=gnu99 -Wall -Wextra -pipe -Os src/make.c -static -s -o make
#+end_src

Once built, we can take a look at the available subcommands:

#+begin_example
$ ./make help
usage: ./make [SUBCMD]
Subcommands:
  help        display this help
  clean       remove previously created build artifacts
  mrproper    same as `clean` plus remove this binary
  check       only run tests

If not provided any subcommand, it runs the full build pipeline.

#+end_example

** Target code

#+begin_src c
// x.h

#pragma once

void inc_int(int *x) {
  ++(*x);
}
#+end_src

** Test case

#+begin_src c
// x_test.c

#include <carbon.h>
#include "x.h"

CARBON_TEST(x, inc_int) {
  int a = 1, b = 0;
  carbon_should_not_be(a, b);
  inc_int(&b);
  carbon_should_be(a, b);
  return CARBON_OK;
}
#+end_src

** Entrypoint

#+begin_src c
// carbon.c

#define CARBON_IMPLEMENTATION
#include <carbon.h>

int main(void) {
  return CARBON_RUN_ALL();
}
#+end_src

If we define the macro ~CARBON_IMPLEMENTATION~, it makes the library operate in a *header-only* structure: all the internal source code of /Carbon/ is included in that translation unit, i.e. no need to compile and link it separately. Alternatively, one can link with the library's internal source code either compiling it ourselves, or using a pre-compiled package of the [[https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon/releases/latest][latest release available]].

#+begin_src sh
cc -I vendor/carbon -std=gnu99 *.c -o carbon
#+end_src

Once built, we can take a look at the available options:

#+begin_example
$ ./carbon -h
usage: ./carbon [OPTION]
Options:
  -n, --no-output  disable JUnit XML test results output
  -o, --output     output JUnit XML test results to specific file (default: `carbon_results.xml`)
  -h, --help       display this help and exit
  -v, --version    output version information and exit

* Code coverage

/Code/ or /test coverage/ is a metric which measures the amount of source code getting executed when a test suite is run. It's important to mention that this measurement doesn't relate by any means to the quality of the codebase, it just reflects how complete and thorough a specific test suite is, nothing more.

Nevertheless, it's a nice metric to have, and it's important that /Carbon/ supports it. As we're working with C/C++, the most used tool for the job is ~gcov~. When using the ~--coverage~ flag, it passes to the compiler/linker specific flags to produce certain code instrumentation.

- The ~*.gcno~ notes files are generated when the source files are compiled with the ~-ftest-coverage~ option (contained inside the ~--coverage~ flag). It contains information to reconstruct the basic block graphs and assign soure line numbers to blocks.
- The ~*.gcda~ count data files are generated when a program linked with ~-lgcov~ option (contained inside the ~--coverage~ flag) containing object files built with the ~-fprofile-arcs~ option (contained inside the ~--coverage~ flag) is executed. It contains arc transition counts, value profile counts and some summary information.

They shouldn't be accessed manually, but with ~gcov~ itself, using one of its formatting options, e.g. ~--json-format~.
