~Carbon~ (/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English][\slash{}ˈkɑːbᵊn\slash{}]]/) is the ultimate *simple* and *easy to use* C/C++ standard library to enjoy programming. @@html:<br>@@
It serves a wide variety of use cases, from CLI programs, graphics-intensive real-time applications, to complex full-fledged testing suites. @@html:<br>@@
If you'd like to make a contribution, you can check the project's [[CONTRIBUTING.org][guidelines]]; also, keep an eye on both security issues reporting [[SECURITY.md][instructions]] and our [[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md][Code of Conduct]]. Furthermore, if you do something cool with /Carbon/, don't forget to add the [[https://github.com/topics/sk-cbn][#sk-cbn]] tag to your /topics/!

[!WARNING]
~Carbon~ is currently in an *alpha* quality stage, and is not production-ready yet.

* Usage

/Carbon/ is in essence a two-part library: the *static/dynamic lib pkg* itself (where all symbols and instructions are defined), and the *C/C++ header file* (which gets generated by the build process as an amalgamation of all internal headers the library uses).

** Get the library

We can get /Carbon/ in our preferred way of managing dependencies or external libraries in our projects. It's important to do so via the *OFFICIAL* Git repository hosted on [[https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon][GitHub]], and not through any other website or server. Appart from that, any ref can be checked out, being ~master~ (the trunk of all dev progress), a tagged commit (e.g. ~v1.0~), an actively maintained version branch (e.g. ~v1.0.y/stable~) or a LTS version branch (e.g. ~v1.0.y/lts~) the preferred ones.

Here are the main options of obtaining it:

*Git Clone:*

#+begin_src sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon
#+end_src

*Pre-compiled Package:*

You might want to take a look to the [[https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon/releases/latest][latest release available]] and download the appropriate pre-compiled package for your CPU's architecture and OS.

#+begin_quote
[!TIP]
You can checkout the [[../INSTALL][installation instructions]], so /Carbon/ can be made available on your system as any other library (the ~PREFIX~ is customizable according to your needs).
#+end_quote

** Examples

A good place to start learning and discovering all the things you can do with /Carbon/ is *reading* and *executing* the [[../examples][examples]].

Furthermore, you can also take a look at the amalgamated distributable *header file* (~carbon.h~), where each module of the library is declared and documented. This is all the documentation you'll ever need, and it's also a good place to find new things /Carbon/ can do.

Lastly, for a more advanced understanding of all available and tested functionality that /Carbon/ provides, *reading* the [[../src_test][tests]] is a great next step. There it can be learnt both how to work with the different modules, and how to use /Carbon/ itself to test your own applications and programs. One can issue the command ~./make test~ to build and run all tests.
