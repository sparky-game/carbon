~Carbon~ (/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English][\slash{}ˈkɑːbᵊn\slash{}]]/) is the ultimate *tiny* and *easy to use* C/C++ standard library to enjoy programming. @@html:<br>@@
It serves a wide variety of use cases, from CLI programs, graphics-intensive real-time applications, to complex full-fledged testing suites. @@html:<br>@@
If you'd like to make a contribution, you can check the project's [[CONTRIBUTING.org][guidelines]]; also, keep an eye on both security issues reporting [[SECURITY.md][instructions]] and our [[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md][Code of Conduct]]. Furthermore, if you do something cool with /Carbon/, don't forget to add the [[https://github.com/topics/sk-cbn][#sk-cbn]] tag to your /topics/!

[!WARNING]
~Carbon~ is currently in an *alpha* quality stage, and is not production-ready yet.

* Usage

/Carbon/ is in essence a two-part library: the *static/dynamic lib pkg* itself (where all symbols and instructions are defined), and the *C/C++ header file* (which gets generated by the build process as an amalgamation of all internal headers the library uses).

** Get the code

We can get /Carbon/ in our preferred way of managing dependencies or external libraries in our projects. It's important to do so via the *OFFICIAL* Git repository hosted on [[https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon][GitHub]], and not through any other website or server. Appart from that, any ref can be checked out, being ~master~ (the trunk of all dev progress), a tagged commit (e.g. ~v1.0~), an actively maintained version branch (e.g. ~v1.0.y/stable~) or a LTS version branch (e.g. ~v1.0.y/lts~) the preferred ones.

Here are the main options of obtaining it:

*Git Clone:*

#+begin_src sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon
#+end_src

*Git Submodule:*

#+begin_src sh
git submodule add https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon [...]
git submodule update --init --recursive
#+end_src

*CMake FetchContent:*

#+end_html

#+begin_src cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  carbon
  GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon"
  GIT_TAG        [...]
  GIT_PROGRESS   TRUE
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(carbon)
#+end_src

*Pre-compiled Package:*

You might want to take a look to the [[https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon/releases/latest][latest release available]] and download the appropriate pre-compiled package for your CPU's architecture and OS.

** Build from source

If wanted to build /Carbon/ from source yourself, it can be done without any problems. We use a custom ~make~ utility (which uses /Carbon/ under the hood) as our build system to manage testing, compiling and packaging the library, both static and dynamic.

This custom build system can rebuild itself properly (using our preferred compilation flags), which means that you'll only need to bootstrap it once:

#+begin_src sh
cc src_build/make.c -o make
#+end_src

Once built, we can take a look at the available subcommands and options by issuing the command ~./make help~. To run the full build pipeline it's just as easy as:

#+begin_src sh
./make
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
[!TIP]
Checkout the [[../INSTALL][installation instructions]] to make /Carbon/ available on your system as any other library (the ~PREFIX~ is customizable according to your needs).
#+end_quote

** Examples

A good place to start learning and discovering all the things you can do with /Carbon/ is *reading* and *executing* the [[../examples][examples]]. One can issue the command ~./make examples~ to build them all: for each example source file (~.c~ or ~.cc~) it produces a ~.bin~ executable file, which can be run normally without problems.

Furthermore, you can also take a look at the amalgamated distributable *header file* (~carbon.h~), where each module of the library is declared and documented. This is all the documentation you'll ever need, and it's also a good place to find new things /Carbon/ can do.

Lastly, for a more advanced understanding of all available and tested functionality that /Carbon/ provides, *reading* the [[../src_test][tests]] is a great next step. There it can be learnt both how to work with the different modules, and how to use /Carbon/ itself to test your own applications and programs. One can issue the command ~./make test~ to build and run all tests.
